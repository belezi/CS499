## Introduction

For my capstone class project I have chosen to work on enhancing a weather dashboard open source project that I took from GitHub [Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/vlaine/Weather-Forecast-Dashboard).



## Professional Self-Assesmnet 

  I started pursing my bachelor's degree at SNHU about 18 months ago. I have been working full time for almost four years as a software developer after having finishing my associates degree from Quincy College. While working at my current position and pursuing the Computer Science degree here at SNHU I have soaked a ton of information and knowledge related to the field which has led me into learning things i had no idea they existed before. 

Becoming a part of the todays workforce takes a lot of energy and time however with the family and friends supporting me and SNHU providing an amazing program online gave me the opportunity to remotely go through the program and complete my degree. Looking back and reflecting to the days when i was thinking about joining the program I am glad that i did and not waited much longer. Thoughout this journey at SNHU has been a lot of ups and downs, times when i have doubted myself whether i can do all the work with the little to no time left on the week sometimes since my work would eat up a lot of my day however i have made it thus far thanks to the support system in my life.

Module Two Journal: What makes a productive code review

Code review is the process where us as developers go through our work and search for bugs, code correctness meaning if naming convention and coding standard are followed though the entire project. This process is a very important part of my job as a developer and I personally see it as a way of improving myself. Code reviews can be personal or on a group setting, which I prefer the most because your peers might have more insight on a certain language or framework, or they could learn a better way of approaching the problem. Most of the time as we near the completion of the feature or incremental being developed we schedule code reviews with our team and the lead developer introduces the problem, solution and the code architecture such as functions reused or created. 

The top three practices that I always stress during code review are documentation, structure and efficiency. I am a strong advocate that any project or feature developed should be given to any developer and they should be able to understand it within an hour or two and hit the ground running. This is very important for both small and large teams and it ensures that if anything goes wrong there would be several developers able to debug the issue in record time. As far as structure I believe that breaking things down to the tiniest pieces and set them up to live independently of each other is good architecture as they can be reused and avoids repeated code in the project. Efficiency I think is something that every developer develops as they gain experience. There are always loops and iterations that all of us deal with on a daily basis however we donâ€™t always think of the most cost-efficient ones and many times we end up with infinite loops that we are not proud of.
