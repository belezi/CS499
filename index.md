  Getting a college degree is a great achievement for every one enrolled in any program, for me it is a very big deal being able to travel to the US and continue my studies. Since at an early age i have been very curious about computers as to how they are build and how they operate. The Computer Science program has given me the oportunity to expand my knowledge and answer a lot of my childhood questions.
