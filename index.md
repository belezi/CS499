## Introduction

For my capstone class project I have chosen to work on enhancing a weather dashboard open source project that I took from GitHub [Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/vlaine/Weather-Forecast-Dashboard).



## Professional Self-Assesmnet 

  I started pursing my bachelor's degree at SNHU about 18 months ago. I have been working full time for almost four years as a software developer after having finishing my associates degree from Quincy College. While working at my current position and pursuing the Computer Science degree here at SNHU I have soaked a ton of information and knowledge related to the field which has led me into learning things i had no idea they existed before. 

Becoming a part of the todays workforce takes a lot of energy and time however with the family and friends supporting me and SNHU providing an amazing program online gave me the opportunity to remotely go through the program and complete my degree. Looking back and reflecting to the days when i was thinking about joining the program I am glad that i did and not waited much longer. Thoughout this journey at SNHU has been a lot of ups and downs, times when i have doubted myself whether i can do all the work with the little to no time left on the week sometimes since my work would eat up a lot of my day however i have made it thus far thanks to the support system in my life.
